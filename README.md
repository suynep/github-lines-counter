# Github Lines + Words Counter

A **Flask** Web application that allows you to enter a GitHub URL to count the number of Lines + Words in. 

Detects the most used language as well.

## TBI
- Language-wise word/line count
- Rank of most used languages in the project
- Currently shows the `extension` of the Programming language used. Need a dictionary to transpile each `ext` to `prog_lang_name` :(
